# Chess tournament orginizer and rating system.
Still work in progress.<br>

A program to orginize a chess torunament and update the players' rating at the end of the event.<br>
The program is also capable of making prediction on the players' performances during the tournament and on the 
result of every match by using the elo system. At the end of the event the program will compute the real 
performace of every player.<br>
Using the data of the tournament (it is possible to insert in the program data from tournamets already 
disputed), the program can perform the chi square test to check the correctness and concretness of the elo 
system model.
